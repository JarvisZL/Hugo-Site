      <description>排序算法 快速排序  Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a &amp;lsquo;pivot&amp;rsquo; element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.  &amp; nums, int l, int r){ int val = nums[r]; int i = l-1; for(int j = l; j &amp; nums, int l, int r){ if(l sortArray(vector&amp; nums) { quicksort(nums,0,nums.</description>
